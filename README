PSGI adapter for CGI::Application::Dispatch

CGI::Application::Dispatch is a (not so) simple dispatcher for families
of CGI::Application-based applications served under common URL base.

It is a little too high-level to be directly converted to PSGI with
CGI::Application::PSGI so the need for a special adapter rose. Here it
is.

	### in your dispatch.psgi:
	use Your::Application::Dispatch;
	use CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI;

	Your::Application::Dispatch->as_psgi;

Most of CGI::Application::Dispatch scripts may be converted by simply
changing "dispatch()" method call to "as_psgi()" call.

The code is a mere mashup of CGI::Application::PSGI and
CGI::Application::Emulate::PSGI, so all the good parts here are courtesy
of their respective authors but the bugs are all mine.
